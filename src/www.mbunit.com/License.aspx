        License Note</p>
    <p>
        This license is based on the open source zlib/libpng license. The idea was to keep
        the license as simple as possible to encourage use of MbUnit in free and commercial
        applications and libraries, but to keep the source code together and to give credit
        to the MbUnit contributors for their efforts. While this license allows shipping
        MbUnit in source and binary form, if shipping a MbUnit variant is the sole purpose
        of your product, please let us know.</p>
