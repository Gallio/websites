    <h2>Welcome to MbUnit</h2>
    <p>
    This is the home of the MbUnit Test Framework for .Net.&nbsp; MbUnit
    provides advanced unit testing support with advanced fixtures to enable developers and testers to test all aspects of their software.
    </p><p>
    There are two current versions of MbUnit, v2 and v3.
    </p><p>
    <b>MbUnit v3</b> is the current version of the MbUnit Framework.  It is based on the <a href="http://www.gallio.org/">Gallio Test Automation Platform</a> which provides a stunning array of interoperable test tools.  MbUnit v3 has been rewritten from the ground up to provide a compelling suite of testing features, native support for .Net 2.0 and .Net 3.5, better documentation, and cross-platform compatibility with Mono.
    </p><p>
    <b>MbUnit v2</b> is the older version of the MbUnit Framework.  It is still actively maintained for the benefit of existing users.
    </p><p>It is possible to use both MbUnit v2 and v3 at the same time with the Gallio test runners.  However, we recommend using MbUnit v3 for all new test projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Please visit the <a href="http://www.gallio.org/">Gallio</a> website for the latest information about Gallio and MbUnit v3.</b>
