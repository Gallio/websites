        About MbUnit</h3>
    <p>
        The framework was first created by Jonathan 'Peli' de Halleux as a hobby project
        while studying for his PhD. Later
        Peli and Jamie Cansdale added support for MbUnit
        to Jamie's NUnitAddin (later it would become the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/"
            onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;
                text-decoration: underline">TestDriven.NET</span></a> addin).&nbsp; After
        Peli's departure to Microsoft in 2005 (working first as a SDET on the CLR and more recently in the Foundations for Software Engineering group in Microsoft Research)
        the project was opensourced under Andy Stopford.

    <p>
        The current lead of MbUnit, Jeff Brown, also leads the <a href="http://www.gallio.org/">Gallio Project</a>.  Since Gallio is the foundation of MbUnit v3, many MbUnit committers also work on Gallio and vice-versa.
    </p>
    <p>
	The projects regular commit members are listed <a href="CommitMembers.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gallio.org/Credits.aspx">here</a>.
